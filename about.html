                <summary>What is the significance of Shiva's 3rd eye?</summary>
                <p>
                    Shiva's third eye represents spiritual wisdom and insight. It symbolizes his ability to see beyond
                    the ordinary and into the essence of things, perceiving truth and knowledge that go beyond the
                    physical realm. The third eye is also said to be the source of Shiva's immense power, and when
                    opened, it can destroy ignorance and evil.

                <summary>What does the snake around Shiva's neck signify?</summary>
                <p>
                    The snake around Shiva's neck symbolizes his mastery over fear and death. In Hindu mythology, the
                    snake (often depicted as Vasuki) represents the cyclical nature of time and life (birth, death, and
                    rebirth). By wearing the snake, Shiva shows that he is beyond the limitations of time and mortality,
                    demonstrating his control over both life and death.

                <summary>Why does Shiva have a blue throat?</summary>
                <p>
                    Shiva's blue throat, known as Neelkanth, is the result of him consuming the deadly poison (Halahala)
                    that emerged during the churning of the cosmic ocean (Samudra Manthan). The poison was so potent
                    that it threatened to destroy all creation. Shiva drank the poison to protect the world, but he held
                    it in his throat to prevent it from harming him. The blue throat symbolizes his immense sacrifice,
                    his ability to absorb the world's negativity, and his role as a protector.

                <summary>Why is Shiva sometimes portrayed as a family man and other times as a hermit?</summary>
                <p>
                    Shiva embodies the paradox of both an ascetic and a householder. As an ascetic, he meditates on
                    Mount Kailash, symbolizing detachment from worldly desires and materialism. On the other hand, as a
                    family man, he is depicted with his wife Parvati and their sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. This duality
                    reflects the balance between renunciation and engagement with the world, illustrating that one can
                    be both a spiritual seeker and part of worldly life.
